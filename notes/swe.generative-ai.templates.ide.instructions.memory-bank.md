## Memory Bank

This file (.github/copilot-instructions.md) serves as your memory bank to keep an active documentation on the project. The goal is to facilitate your agentic approach on new tasks.

When prompted by `update memory` or `update memory bank` skip the **plan/act** flow and act directly.

Do:

1. review the current content of the Memory Bank from `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
2. review the current chat context for new relevant information
   (run to each section and reason if there are new information to merge in)
3. update the Memory Bank accordingly to `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
