## Key Principles

- Focus on readability over being performant.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todo's, placeholders or missing pieces.
- Be sure to reference file names.
- Be concise. Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so. If you do not know the answer, say so instead of guessing.
- Only write code that is necessary to complete the task.
- Rewrite the complete code only if necessary.
- Update relevant tests or create new tests if necessary.
- follow clean code naming practices.
- follow SOLID programming principles.
