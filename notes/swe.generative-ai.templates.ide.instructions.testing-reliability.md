## Testing and reliability

- **Always create unit tests for new features**.
- **After updating any logic**: check whether existing unit tests needs to be updated. If so, do it.
- For each function or method, test at least one successful scenario, one intentional failure (to ensure proper error handling), and one edge case.
- **Always** mock calls to services like Database so you're not interacting with anything "for real".
