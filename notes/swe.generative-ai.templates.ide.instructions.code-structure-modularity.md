## Code Structure and Modularity

- **Never create a file larger than 500 lines of code**. If a file approaches this limit refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
- **Use clear, consistent imports**.
