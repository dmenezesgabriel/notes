# ü§ñ The Seven Node Blueprint for AI Agents ü§ñ

## **Agents are just graphs.**

Viewing AI agents as graphs provides a powerful mental model for designing systems. This approach breaks down complex agents into interconnected nodes, each with specific responsibilities. By thinking in graphs, we can:

- **Modularize functionality** for better maintenance
- **Scale complexity** through simple component connections
- **Improve resilience** with explicit error handling paths
- **Enable transparency** by making information flow visible

This is how you can design complex systems with ease (when necessary).

## Node Types

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ LLM Node üß†

**Purpose**: Reasoning, generation, and decision-making

**Examples**: Planning, content generation, summarization

**Why it's useful**: Acts as the "brain" that processes information and coordinates between components, handling ambiguity and novel situations.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Tool Node üõ†Ô∏è

**Purpose**: Executes external tools or APIs

**Examples**: Web search, code execution, database queries

**Why it's useful**: Extends capabilities beyond language processing, connecting the agent to external systems and real-time data.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Control Node ‚öôÔ∏è

**Purpose**: Handles logic, branching, and deterministic rules

**Examples**: Routing, conditionals, filters

**Why it's useful**: Introduces predictability and enables consistent handling of different cases and business logic.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Memory Node üìö

**Purpose**: Reads/writes to memory for stateful context

**Examples**: Vector DBs, conversation history, user preferences

**Why it's useful**: Maintains context over time, enabling personalization and self-evolution.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Guardrail Node üöß

**Purpose**: Validates outputs and enforces constraints

**Examples**: Content filtering, format validation, safety checks

**Why it's useful**: Ensures outputs meet required standards, preventing harmful or incorrect responses.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Fallback Node üîÑ

**Purpose**: Responds to failures with retries or alternate flows

**Examples**: Retries, escalation paths, default responses

**Why it's useful**: Provides graceful degradation when things go wrong rather than complete failure.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ User Input Node üë•

**Purpose**: Brings humans into the loop for clarification or decisions

**Examples**: Confirmations, clarification requests, approvals

**Why it's useful**: Leverages human judgment for critical situations where AI might not be sufficient.

## Building with the Blueprint

When designing agents as graphs:

1. **Start simple**, then add complexity as needed
2. **Identify natural breakpoints** for different node types
3. **Plan for failures** with fallbacks and validation
4. **Balance automation with control** through human touchpoints
5. **Visualize the flow** to spot bottlenecks or unnecessary complexity

By thoughtfully combining these node types, we can build AI systems that are more capable, reliable, and aligned with human needs.
