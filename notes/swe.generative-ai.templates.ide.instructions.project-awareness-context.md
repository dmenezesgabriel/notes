## Project Awareness and Context

- Always read **PLANNING.md** (_if the file exists_) to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints
- Check **TASKS.md** (_if the file exists_) before starting a new task. If the task isn't listed, add it with a brief description and today's date
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in **PLANNING.md**
