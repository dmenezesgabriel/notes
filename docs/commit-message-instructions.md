Follow the conventional commit message format. Limit the first line to 72 characters or less. Use the structure below:

**Type and Scope**: Choose an appropriate type (e.g., `feat`, `fix`) and optional scope to describe the affected module or feature

**Description**: Write a concise, informative description in the header, use backticks if referencing code or specific terms.

**Body**: For additional details, use a well-structured body section:

- Use bullet points (`*`) for clarity.
- Clearly describe the motivation, context, or technical details behind the change, if applicable.

Commit messages should be clear, informative, and professional, aiding readability and project tracking.
