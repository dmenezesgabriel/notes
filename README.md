# Notes vault

Welcome to my Notes Vault! This repository serves as a personal space for organizing and storing my study materials and miscellaneous notes in plain Markdown files.

## Why this workflow?

I chose this workflow because it allows me to keep my notes as plain Markdown files. This ensures they are lightweight, portable, and easy to edit across different platforms and devices.

## Tools I use

- [VS Code Dendron](https://wiki.dendron.so/): A structured note-taking extension for Visual Studio Code that helps me maintain and navigate my notes seamlessly.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/): A powerful knowledge base tool I use on mobile for quick edits and reference.
- [MGit](https://github.com/maks/MGit): A Git client for Android, allowing me to sync and manage my notes directly from my mobile devic
- [Termux](https://termux.dev/en/): A terminal emulator for Android, providing a Linux environment for advanced note management and customization.
